Challenge 2: Register for a new game

Create a program that allows a new player in a game to ‘register’ for that game.
To register for the game, players must enter their age, gender, an email address and a player name.
Follow the tasks below to complete this:
Display on the screen a welcome message to the new player for the game.
Ask the player to enter their age, gender and email address and a player name. (These values should be stored in appropriately named variables)
Display this information on the screen and ask the player to confirm whether or not it is correct.
IF the information is incorrect, ask the player to re-enter the information.
Display the CORRECT information on the screen to complete the registration.
Add comments to your program to explain how it works.
