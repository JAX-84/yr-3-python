Challenge 3: Registering a new player
Nana runs an annual gaming league for the online card game, "You Dunn Know". Players from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia play You Dunn Know. They pay an entry fee to take part. Nana arranges the fixtures between players and informs them of the times and dates that they need to play.
Players need to enter their personal details in order to enter a card league.

Here is what you need to code
Display a title stating: League registration.
Ask the player to enter: first name, last name, nickname, and email address.
Ask the player to enter a skill level, using E for ‘Expert’ or C for ‘Casual’.
Display the player’s personal details on the screen.
If the player entered E then ‘Expert’ should be displayed; if they entered C then ‘Casual’ should be displayed.
Ask the player to confirm that all of the personal details are correct.
If any detail is incorrect, ask the player to re-enter all of the personal details and display them again.
